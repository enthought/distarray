IPython Distributed Arrays
==========================

This is the official IPython `distarray` package. It provides dense,
multidimensional distributed memory arrays for Python. These arrays are
designed to look and feel just like `NumPy`_ arrays, but they work on parallel
architectures with distributed memory.
