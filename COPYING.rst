Our Copyright Policy
--------------------

IPython uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over
their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the IPython
source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire IPython
Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their
copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to
one of the IPython repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:
